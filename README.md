# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview / Purpose
The goal of this project is to use a type of machiene learning, neural network analysis, to determine the impact of charitable donations. When giving money to various organizations, it is important to determine which donations will bring a positive return on the investment. Through a series of filtering through various input data, this neural network will determine which organizations will be impactful after receiving a donation. 

## Results 
### Data Preprocessing 
-The target for this model is to determine the output of the column "Is_Successful." The goal is to recieve a return on investment, therefore, we want to advise to donation to charities that return "yes" for Is_Successful.

-The features of this model include "Application_Type" and "Classification." Because of their ability to group various charitable causes, which will determine what groups of causes result in positive outcomes.

-Columns that are neither features nor targets include description of identification attributs such as the "Name" and "EIN" which are specific to each individual row, and they do not help us when grouping alike chairities. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the model
